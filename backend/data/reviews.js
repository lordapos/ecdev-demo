    title: 'What a dandy little camera',
    review: 'I own, and have used for at least twenty eight years, several view cameras, currently I have, 6 or 7, so maybe this gives me some qualification. I have only seen three or four Technikardan Cameras, I own a 6 X 9. This camera is incredible compact folded up, and relative light, I own a lighter 4 X 5, I do not use it, and if you had a choice between the two neither would you. I carry this camera almost every where I go, in my backpack, along with two Super Rollex 6 X 9 film backs.'
